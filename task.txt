Hello Benjamin,

We would like to have give you an opportunity, 
to play around with some open-source data, that is like our work.

Please use Python 3.x version (you are free to use any open source Py 
or c++ packages) to work with Lidar data and Radar data in the 
nuScenes https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes#download dataset.

Please do the following tasks:

Write a program to 

- visualize Surround camera images in window 1 
- visualize Lidar and Radar data in window 2

You may use any open-source lib. to cluster the lidar data per 
timeframe and visualize them in the window 2.

You may take a week time to work on this task and let us discuss your results say on 09.08. 15 hrs, is it ok for you?

You have to submit your source code and results for our 2nd discussion.

Meanwhile if you have any questions on this task, you may write to us, either one of us would respond to your question.

Thank you, have fun,

Bharani.
